      A simple demo for the ruby gem <%= link_to 'Shrine', "https://rubygems.org/gems/shrine/" %>.
      Shrine is a toolkit for file attachments in Ruby applications. It supports uploading, downloading, processing and
      deleting IO objects, backed by various storage engines. It uses efficient streaming for low memory usage. Shrine
      comes with a high-level interface for attaching uploaded files to database records, saving their location and
      metadata to a database column, and tying them to record's lifecycle. It natively supports background jobs and
      direct uploads for fully asynchronous user experience.
